They are usually found in forests with good coverage of leaf litter. Photo taken in Supatá, Cundinamarca. In situ.](Imagenes_para_web/Foto%20pandi%20sebas%20copyright.png)\n\n*09/2017-07/2018*\n\n**Objective:** Provide a conservation status reassessment of *B. pandi* and describe the relationships between habitat structure and natural history traits of the species.\n\nI participated in this project in collaboration of multiple colleagues and researchers, the project was led by Teddy Angarita-Sierra. My participation included collection of research data through standardized sampling of amphibians and reptiles, community work through surveys and workshops with local populations, taxonomic identification of amphibians and statistical analysis.\n\n## **Community empowerment project for the conservation of reptiles and amphibians of Cundinamarca**\n\n![The project included scientific illustration workshops which helped the community recognize the local herpetofauna biodiversity.](Imagenes_para_web/para%20empoderamiento%20comunitario.jpg)\n\n09/2019-03/2020\n\n**Objective:** Empower and sensitize the Supata's (Cundinamarca) community with knowledge about amphibians and reptiles, their importance and guide them through concrete conservation actions.\n\nThe ocurrence list of herpetofauna that we (research group BIOTUN) collected in the previous project, helped us to create an outreach project. Here we planned activites, workshops, table games and different strategies to approach the community and share the knowledge gathered about amphibians and reptiles. I had the opportunity to be the coordinator of the project were I had to manage the activities, plan the workshops, create the surveys, and facilitate team-working spaces in order to discuss about the project objectives.\n\n## **Serpientes y gente project**\n\n![The project was created by the research group BIOTUN and financed by Project Management Program (PGP in spanish) of the UNAL. On it we illustrated +150 handmade illustrations for a book of snakes. ](Imagenes_para_web/proyecto%20serpientes%20y%20gente.jpg)\n\n*05/2021-12/2022*\n\n**Objective:** Sensitize Supata municipality and surrounding communities about myths, beliefs, biology, importance and conservation of the snakes in our ecosystems.\n\nDuring the pandemic I coordinated this project, we created virtual talks, workshops and offline creative material, oriented to show that snakes are not bad as it is though, as well as their biology and conservation importance. Besides, I guided the production of the book Serpientes y Gente, with more than 150 handmade illustrations and 10 chapters focused on changing the negative perception that people usually have about snakes.\n\n## **Mutis, Röther, and Pérez-Arbeláez: An encounter between architecture and Andean biodiversity**\n\n![One way to visualize and share the Andean vines diversity was by high quality photographs of the specie. This was done by showing most of their parts on Lankester plates. They were created by me with the help of the biologist Daniela Guevara.](Imagenes_para_web/Composici%C3%B3n%20adulterina%20web.png)\n\n*10/2022-09/2023*\n\n**Objective:** Propose an strategy to integrate architectural design, vines biodiversity and history of botanic expeditions to promote knowledge of botany and patrimony appropriation.\n\nProject led by Dr. Argenis Bonilla. I contributed by searching for potential Andean vines species of *Passiflora, Bomarea* and *Mutisia* that could be used for an building called pergola. In addition I collected vegetative material to include it in the occurrences and deposit on National Herbarium (COL). I took photographs in field of the species and created Lankester plates to show the different structures in a informative way. Finally I designed a approximation to the refuges usage of the *Atractus crassicaudatus* populations of the campus UNAL.\n\n## **Spatial distribution of *Andinobates supata* individuals in relation to the microhabitats used for reproduction**\n\n![*Andinobates supata* is a tiny dart frog (less than 2 cm). This species lives in small fragments of Andean forests, being threatened by deforestation and illegal traficking.](Imagenes_para_web/andinobates.png)\n\n*09/2022-07/2023*\n\n**Objective:** Analyze spatial distribution of the individuals of *Andinobates supata* in relationship with potential micro-habitats used for tadpole deposition.\n\nProject led by the biologist Daniela Guevara. I worked as co-researcher, helping coordinate the surveys and monitoring activities, collecting data and filming and photographing natural history events. Additionally, I helped in the spatial analysis in R Studio. We will provide new findings about their spatial distribution and reproductive behavior.\n\n## **Taxonomic evaluation of *Hyloxalus subpunctatus* complex populations from Supatá, Cundinamarca**\n\n![This species group is characterized by being highly criptic and elusive. Usually the males carry their tadpoles and leave them in small ponds on the forest floor, so they can finish their development.](Imagenes_para_web/hyloxalus.png)\n\n**Objective:** Evaluate acoustic, morphological and ecological characteristics of species of the complex *Hyloxalus subpunctatus* and provide different lines evidence in support of the hypothesis of a new species.\n\nI coordinated this project, were I managed all steps in the research from planning to executing and data analyzing. I worked with the herpetologist Daniela Guevara, we searched for specimens of species of the *H. subpunctatus* complex, obtained genetic and ecological data, measured morphometric and acoustic variables, and compared them statistically in order to test variability and discrimination on different lines of evidence among the considered species. Right now I am working on the results of this research which led to the discovery of a new specie of frog.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"projects.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":"Minty","title":"Projects"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
