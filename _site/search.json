    "text": "I am a passionate biologist with experience and knowledge in the taxonomy, ecology and bioacoustics of amphibians and reptiles. I have been involved in multiple projects, which has equipped me with skills in project design and development, biodiversity monitoring, and science communication. My primary goal is to highlight the ecological significance of anurans, engage local communities in understanding these organisms, and contribute to the conservation efforts of these vulnerable taxonomic groups.\nI am interested in eliciting the patterns and processes behind the reproductive and parental care behavior of frogs. Additionally, I want to do an approach to the statistical and bioacoustical analysis methods in biology and how we can improve it through novel technologies such as machine learning and data science.\nAbout my hobbies, I enjoy going hiking, walking in forests and nearby waterfalls, I like to do wild nature photography and practicing watercolors illustration."

My participation included collection of research data through standardized sampling of amphibians and reptiles, community work through surveys and workshops with local populations, taxonomic identification of amphibians and statistical analysis."

Here we planned activites, workshops, table games and different strategies to approach the community and share the knowledge. I had the opportunity to be the coordinator of the project were I had to manage the activities and the research group team."

Besides, I guided the production of the book Serpientes y Gente, with more than 150 handmade illustrations and 10 chapters focused in the objective of the project."

They were created by me with the help of the biologist Daniela Guevara.\n\n\n10/2022-09/2023\nObjective: Propose an strategy to integrate architectural design, vines biodiversity and history of botanic expeditions to promote knowledge and patrimony appropriation.\nProject led by Dr. Argenis Bonilla, I participated by searching for potential Andean vines species of Passiflora, Bomarea and Mutisia that could be used for an building called pergola. In addition I collected vegetative material to include it in the occurrences and deposit on National Herbarium (COL). I took photographs in field of the species and created Lankester plates to show the different structures in a informative way. Finally I designed a approximation to the refuges usage and population of the Atractus crassicaudatus populations of the campus UNAL."
