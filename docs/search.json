    "text": "I am a passionate biologist with experience and knowledge in the taxonomy, ecology and bioacoustics of amphibians and reptiles. I am an investigator linked to the research group Biologia de Organismos Tropicales (BIOTUN) since 2017. I have been involved in multiple projects, which has equipped me with skills in project design and development, biodiversity monitoring, and science communication. My primary goal is to highlight the ecological significance of anurans, engage local communities in understanding these organisms, and contribute to the conservation efforts of these vulnerable taxonomic groups.\nI am interested in eliciting the patterns and processes behind the reproductive and parental care behavior of frogs. Additionally, I want to do an approach to the statistical and bioacoustical analysis methods in biology and how we can improve it through novel technologies such as machine learning and data science.\nAbout my hobbies, I enjoy going hiking, walking in forests and nearby waterfalls, I like to do wild nature photography and practicing watercolors illustration."

In situ.\n\n\n09/2017-07/2018\nObjective: Provide a conservation status reassessment of B. pandi and describe the relationships between habitat structure and natural history traits of the species.\nI participated in this project in collaboration of multiple colleagues and researchers, the project was led by Teddy Angarita-Sierra. My participation included collection of research data through standardized sampling of amphibians and reptiles, community work through surveys and workshops with local populations, taxonomic identification of amphibians and statistical analysis."

Here we planned activites, workshops, table games and different strategies to approach the community and share the knowledge gathered about amphibians and reptiles. I had the opportunity to be the coordinator of the project were I had to manage the activities, plan the workshops, create the surveys, and facilitate team-working spaces in order to discuss about the project objectives."

Besides, I guided the production of the book Serpientes y Gente, with more than 150 handmade illustrations and 10 chapters focused on changing the negative perception that people usually have about snakes."

This was done by showing most of their parts on Lankester plates. They were created by me with the help of the biologist Daniela Guevara.\n\n\n10/2022-09/2023\nObjective: Propose an strategy to integrate architectural design, vines biodiversity and history of botanic expeditions to promote knowledge of botany and patrimony appropriation.\nProject led by Dr. Argenis Bonilla. I contributed by searching for potential Andean vines species of Passiflora, Bomarea and Mutisia that could be used for an building called pergola. In addition I collected vegetative material to include it in the occurrences and deposit on National Herbarium (COL). I took photographs in field of the species and created Lankester plates to show the different structures in a informative way. Finally I designed a approximation to the refuges usage of the Atractus crassicaudatus populations of the campus UNAL."

I worked as co-researcher, helping coordinate the surveys and monitoring activities, collecting data and filming and photographing natural history events. Additionally, I helped in the spatial analysis in R Studio. We will provide new findings about their spatial distribution and reproductive behavior."

Usually the males carry their tadpoles and leave them in small ponds on the forest floor, so they can finish their development.\n\n\nObjective: Evaluate acoustic, morphological and ecological characteristics of species of the complex Hyloxalus subpunctatus and provide different lines evidence in support of the hypothesis of a new species.\nI coordinated this project, were I managed all steps in the research from planning to executing and data analyzing. I worked with the herpetologist Daniela Guevara, we searched for specimens of species of the H. subpunctatus complex, obtained genetic and ecological data, measured morphometric and acoustic variables, and compared them statistically in order to test variability and discrimination on different lines of evidence among the considered species. Right now I am working on the results of this research which led to the discovery of a new specie of frog."
