*09/2017-07/2018*

**Objective:** Provide a conservation status reassessment of *B. pandi* and describe the relationships between habitat structure and natural history traits of the species.

I participated in this project in collaboration of multiple colleagues and researchers, the project was led by Teddy Angarita-Sierra. My participation included collection of research data through standardized sampling of amphibians and reptiles, community work through surveys and workshops with local populations, taxonomic identification of amphibians and statistical analysis.
