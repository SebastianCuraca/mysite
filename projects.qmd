*09/2017-07/2018*

**Objective:** Provide a conservation status reassessment of *B. pandi* and describe the relationships between habitat structure and natural history traits of the species.

I participated in this project in collaboration of multiple colleagues and researchers, the project was led by Teddy Angarita-Sierra. My participation included collection of research data through standardized sampling of amphibians and reptiles, community work through surveys and workshops with local populations, taxonomic identification of amphibians and statistical analysis.

## **Community empowerment project for the conservation of reptiles and amphibians of Cundinamarca**

**Objective:** Empower and sensitize the Supata's (Cundinamarca) community with knowledge about amphibians and reptiles, their importance and guide them through concrete conservation actions.

The ocurrence list of herpetofauna that we (research group BIOTUN) collected in the previous project, helped us to create an outreach project. Here we planned activites, workshops, table games and different strategies to approach the community and share the knowledge. I had the opportunity to be the coordinator of the project were I had to manage the activities and the research group team.

## **Serpientes y gente project**

*05/2021-12/2022*

**Objective:** Sensitize Supata municipality and surrounding communities about biology, importance, conservation and myths of snakes.

During the pandemic I coordinated this project, we created virtual talks, workshops and offline creative material, oriented to show that snakes are not bad as it is though, their biology and conservation importance. Besides, I guided the production of the book Serpientes y Gente, with more than 150 handmade illustrations and 10 chapters focused in the objective of the project.

## **Mutis, Röther, and Pérez-Arbeláez: An encounter between architecture and Andean biodiversity**

![One way to visualize and share the andean vines diversity was by high quality photographs of the species, showing most of their parts on Lankester plates. They were created by me with the help of the biologist Daniela Guevara.](Imagenes_para_web/Composici%C3%B3n%20adulterina%20web.png)

*10/2022-09/2023*

**Objective:** Propose an strategy to integrate architectural design, vines biodiversity and history of botanic expeditions to promote knowledge and patrimony appropriation.

Project led by Dr. Argenis Bonilla, I participated by searching for potential Andean vines species of *Passiflora, Bomarea* and *Mutisia* that could be used for an building called pergola. In addition I collected vegetative material to include it in the occurrences and deposit on National Herbarium (COL). I took photographs in field of the species and created Lankester plates to show the different structures in a informative way. Finally I designed a approximation to the refuges usage and population of the *Atractus crassicaudatus* populations of the campus UNAL.
